# User-Data-Analytic-using-ETL

<p>The files above are the python code Iâ€™ve created to perform Extract and Transform from a simple user dataset to provide User Data Analytics that can be used to provide useful data for data analyst and data scientist.</p>

<h3>This dataset consists of 5000 rows of data (5000 registrants) in CSV (Comma-separated values) format and has several columns including:</h3>

<p>participant_id: ID of the participant/participant of the hackathon. This column is unique so that each participant must have a different ID</p>
<p>first_name: participant's first name</p>
<p>last_name: participant's last name</p>
<p>birth_date: participant's date of birth</p>
<p>address: participant's residence address</p>

<p>country: participant's country of origin</p>
<p>institute: the current participating institution, can be the name of the company or the name of the university</p>
<p>occupation: participant's current job</p>
